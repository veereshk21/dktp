ALTHOUGH YOUR CUSTOMER AGREEMENT IS A SEPARATE           DOCUMENT, EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WAIVERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES,           AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF YOUR CUSTOMER AGREEMENT ARE INCORPORATED BY THIS REFERENCE IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND SHALL SURVIVE           TERMINATION OF YOUR CUSTOMER AGREEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, ANY DISPUTES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE           WITH THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS IN YOUR CUSTOMER AGREEMENT UNDER THE HEADING: &amp;ldquo;HOW DO I RESOLVE DISPUTES           WITH VERIZON WIRELESS,&amp;rdquo; WHICH TERMS ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. SPECIFICALLY, YOU AND VERIZON WIRELESS BOTH AGREE           TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ONLY BY ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JUDGE           OR JURY IN ANY ARBITRATION.          &lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;           &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;PAYMENTS.&lt;/span&gt; Payment is due as stated on your bill. IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE PAYMENT WITHIN 15 DAYS OF THE DUE DATE, WE MAY CHARGE           YOU A LATE PAYMENT FEE OF UP TO 5% OF THE UNPAID BALANCE OF YOUR BILL OR $5, WHICHEVER IS LESS, except where prohibited by           law. Your specific payment schedule is provided above. Returned checks will be subject to a fee of up to $25, except where           prohibited by law. Payments you make will be applied first to balances due under your Customer Agreement and then to balances           due under this Agreement. If you have more than one Retail Installment Sales Agreement on your account, payments will be            applied to the oldest one first, and then to more recent ones in order of age; if two Retail Installment Sales Agreements            are entered into on the same day, the one added to our system first will be deemed older.Your payment            schedule is determined by the date that you accept these terms and conditions, which allows us to apply charges to            your bill. If you order a Device that is not available for shipment at the time of order, we will provide you            with a payment schedule based on our best estimate of when your Device will be shipped. Your first payment           will not be due until the Device is shipped, at which point we will charge the credit card you provided at the time of your           Order or, if eligible apply the first payment to your bill. For any Device not available for shipment at the time of order,           you agree that we may update the estimated payment schedule when your Device is shipped, and we will provide the new payment           schedule to you in writing. Additionally, if a delay in accepting this Agreement or activating your Device results in any           charges becoming due on a date(s) later than the payment schedule, we will provide you with an updated payment schedule on           your bill. If you do not activate your Device within 45 days of receipt, or if you cancel your Customer Agreement, you agree            that Verizon Wireless may charge, and you agree to pay, the entire remaining balance owed for your Device as soon as your next bill.           If your Device qualifies for an Early Upgrade offer, visit &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; onclick=&quot;return false;&quot;&gt;verizonwireless.com/upgradeterms&lt;/a&gt; for further details, terms and conditions.          &lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;           &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;PREPAYMENT.&lt;/span&gt; You may pay the total amount due under this Agreement at any time before the final scheduled payment is due,            and you will not have to pay a penalty.  If you pay more than the monthly  payment due any excess amount you pay will be credited to your account,            and applied to any future charges pursuant to Section 2 above.          &lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;           &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;RISK OF LOSS: INSURANCE.&lt;/span&gt; You bear the entire risk of loss, theft or damage to the Device from any cause during            the term of this Agreement. Even if the Device is lost, stolen or damaged, you remain obligated for the total of the payments. We           recommend that you obtain property insurance on the Device. You may obtain property insurance from others on goods purchased under this Agreement.          &lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;           &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;DEFAULT AND REMEDIES.&lt;/span&gt; You are in default under this Agreement if you fail to make any required payment when due or within           fifteen (15) days of the due date; you cancel your Customer Agreement; we cancel your Customer Agreement for good cause; you           breach any covenant, representation or warranty hereunder, or default in the performance of any other obligation which is           not cured within ten (10) days after written notice to you; or we terminate your Service for breach           (each a &amp;ldquo;Default&amp;rdquo;).

In this Customer Agreement, you&apos;ll find important information about your Service, including our ability to make changes to your Service \ror this agreement&apos;s terms, our liability if things don&apos;t work as planned and how any disputes between us must be resolved in arbitration or small claims court. If you&apos;re \rsigning up for Service for a minimum contract term, you&apos;ll also find information about that contract term and what happens if you cancel a line of Service early or don&apos;t pay on \rtime, including the possibility of an early termination fee you may owe Verizon Wireless.</strong></p>\r\r<h4>My Service</h4>\r<p><strong>Your Service terms and conditions are part of this agreement.</strong> Your Plan includes your monthly allowances and features, where you can use them (your &quot;Coverage \rArea&quot;), and their monthly and pay&ndash;per&ndash;use charges. You can also subscribe to several Optional Services, like data add-on packages. Together, your Plan and any Optional \rServices you select are your Service. The terms and conditions for your Service can be found in the brochures that are available when you activate, or online at \r<strong>verizonwireless.com</strong></p> \r\r<h4>How do I accept this Agreement?</h4>\r<p>You accept this Agreement by:</p> \r<ul> <li>Agreeing in writing, by email, over the phone, or in person;</li> \r<li>Opening a package that says you are accepting by opening it; or</li> \r<li>Activating your Service.</li> </ul> \r<p>When you accept, you&apos;re representing that you are at least 18 years old and are legally able to accept an agreement. If you&apos;re accepting for an organization, you&apos;re \rrepresenting that you are authorized to bind that organization, and where the context requires, \"you\" means the organization. By accepting, you are agreeing to every provision of this \rAgreement whether or not you have to read it.</p> \r<p><strong>If you do accept, you can cancel a line of Service within 14 days of accepting this Agreement without having to pay an early termination fee as long as you return, within the \rapplicable return period, any equipment you purchased from us or one of our authorized agents at a discount in connection with your acceptance of this Agreement, but you&apos;ll still have \rto pay for your Service through that date. If you signed up for Prepaid Service, no refunds will be granted after 14 days or if your account has been activated.</strong> <br /> <br />If you \rchange your device or receive a Service promotion, you may be required to change your Plan to one that we are currently offering at that time.</p> \r\r<h4>My privacy</h4>\r<p>We collect personal information about you. We gather some information through our relationship with you, such as information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination and amount of your use of our telecommunications services. You can find out how we use, share and protect the information we collect about you in our Privacy Policy, available at Verizon.com/Privacy. By entering this Agreement, you consent to our data collection, use and sharing practices described in our Privacy Policy. It is your responsibility to notify people who connect devices through your mobile hotspot, Jetpack or wireless router that we will collect, use and share information about their device and use of the Service in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We provide you with choices to limit, in certain circumstances, our use of the data we have about you. You can review these choices at Verizon.com/Privacy#limits. If there are additional specific advertising and marketing practices for which your consent is necessary, we will seek your consent (such as through the privacy-related notices you receive when you purchase or use our products and services) before engaging in those practices. If you subscribe to Service for which usage charges are billed at the end of the billing period (“Postpay Service”), we may investigate your credit history at any time and share credit information about you with credit reporting agencies and other Verizon companies. If you’d like the name and address of any credit agency that gives us a credit report about you, just ask.</p>\r\r<p>Many services and applications offered through your device may be provided by third parties. Before you use, link to or download a service or application provided by a third party, you should review the terms of such service or application and applicable privacy policy. Personal information you submit may be read, collected or used by the service or application provider and/or other users of those forums.</p>\r\r<p>You consent to allow Verizon Wireless and anyone who collects on our behalf to contact you about your account status, including past due or current charges, using prerecorded calls, email and calls or messages delivered by an automatic telephone dialing system to any wireless phone number or email address you provide. Verizon Wireless will treat any email address you provide as your private email that is not accessible by unauthorized third parties. Unless you notify us that your wireless service is based in a different time zone, calls will be made to your cellular device during permitted calling hours based upon the time zone affiliated with the mobile telephone number you provide.</p>\r\r <h4>What happens if my Postpay Service is canceled before the end of my contract term?</h4>\r <p>If you&apos;re signing up for Postpay Service, you&apos;re agreeing to subscribe to a line of Service either on a month&ndash;to&ndash;month basis or for a minimum contract term, as \rshown on your receipt or order confirmation. (If your Service is suspended without billing, or at a reduced billing rate, that time doesn&apos;t count toward completing your contract term.) \rOnce you&apos;ve completed your contract term, you&apos;ll automatically become a customer on a month&ndash;to&ndash;month basis for that line of Service. <strong>If you cancel a line of \rService, or if we cancel it for good cause, during its contract term, you&apos;ll have to pay an early termination fee. If your contract term results from your purchase of an advanced \rdevice on or after November 14, 2014, your early termination fee will be &#36;350, which will decline by: &#36;10 per month upon completion of months 7&ndash;17, by &#36;20 per month upon \rcompletion of months 18&ndash;22, and by &#36;60 upon completion of month 23 and will be &#36;0 upon completion of your contract term. For other contract terms entered into on or after \rNovember 14, 2014, your early termination fee will be &#36;175, which will decline by &#36;5 per month upon completion of months 7&ndash;17, &#36;10 per month upon completion of months \r18&ndash;22, &#36;30 upon completion of month 23 and will be &#36;0 upon completion of your contract term. If your contract results from your purchase of an advanced device prior to \rNovember 14, 2014, your early termination fee will be &#36;350 minus &#36;10 for each full month of your contract term that you complete. For other contract terms entered into prior to \rNovember 14, 2014, your early termination fee will be &#36;175 minus &#36;5 for each full month of your contract term that you complete. Cancellations will become effective on the last day \rof that month&apos;s billing cycle,</strong> and you are responsible for all charges incurred until then. Also, if you bought your wireless device from an authorized agent or \rthird&ndash;party vendor, you should check whether they charge a separate termination fee.</p>\r\r<h4>Can I take my wireless phone number to another carrier?</h4>\r<p>You may be able to take, or \"port\", your wireless phone number to another carrier. If you port a number from us, we&apos;ll treat it as though you asked us to cancel your Service for \rthat number. After the porting is completed, you won&apos;t be able to use our service for that number, but you&apos;ll remain responsible for all fees and charges through the end of that \rbilling cycle, just like any other cancellation. If you&apos;re a Prepaid customer, you won&apos;t be entitled to a refund of any balance on your account. If you port a number to us, please \rbe aware that we may not be able to provide some services right away, such as 911 location services. You don&apos;t have any rights to your wireless phone number, except for any right you \rmay have to port it.</p> \r\r<h4>Directory information</h4> <p>We will not publish your wireless phone number in any available directory or give it to anyone for that purpose, unless you ask us to.</p> \r\r<h4>Can I have someone else manage my Postpay account?</h4>\r<p>No problem &ndash; just tell us by phone, in person, or in writing. You can appoint someone to manage your Postpay account for a single transaction, or until you tell us otherwise. The \rperson you appoint will be able to make changes to your account, including adding new lines of Service, buying new wireless devices, and extending your contract term. Any changes that \rperson makes will be treated as modifications to this agreement.</p> \r\r<h4>Can Verizon Wireless change this Agreement or my Service?</h4>\r<p>We may change prices or any other term of your Service or this agreement at any time,but we&apos;ll provide notice first, including written notice if you have Postpay Service. If you use \ryour Service after the change takes effect, that means you&apos;re accepting the change. If you&apos;re a Postpay customer and a change to your Plan or this agreement has a material adverse \reffect on you, you can cancel the line of Service that has been affected within 60 days of receiving the notice with no early termination fee if we fail to negate the change after you \rnotify us of your objection to it. Notwithstanding this provision, if we make any changes to the dispute resolution provision of this Agreement, such changes will not affect the resolution \rof any disputes that arose before such change.</p>\r\r<h4>My wireless device</h4>\r<p>Your wireless device must comply with Federal Communications Commission regulations, be certified for use on our network, and be compatible with your Service. Please be aware that we may \rchange your wireless device&apos;s software, applications or programming remotely, without notice. This could affect your stored data, or how you&apos;ve programmed or use your wireless \rdevice. By activating Service that uses a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card, you agree that we own the intellectual property and software in the SIM card, that we may change the \rsoftware or other data in the SIM card remotely and without notice, and that we may utilize any capacity in the SIM card for administrative, network, business and/or commercial purposes. If \ryou bought a wireless device for Postpay Service from Verizon Wireless that doesn&apos;t use a SIM card, and you want to reprogram it for use with another wireless network, the default \rprogramming code is set to \"000000\" or \"123456.\" But please note that your wireless device may not work with another wireless network, or the other wireless carrier may not accept your \rwireless device on its network.  If you activate a 3G phone&ndash;in&ndash;the&ndash;box wireless device for Prepaid Service, it can only be used for Prepaid Service during the first six \r(6) months after activation. If you activate a 4G LTE phone&ndash;in&ndash;the&ndash;box wireless device for Prepaid Service, it cannot be used with any other service until it is first \ractivated on Prepaid Service and the first monthly payment is made.</p>\r\r<h4>Where and how does Verizon Wireless Service work?</h4>\r<p>Wireless devices use radio transmissions, so unfortunately you can&apos;t get Service if your device isn&apos;t in range of a transmission signal. And please be aware that even within \ryour Coverage Area, many things can affect the availability and quality of your Service, including network capacity, your device, terrain, buildings, foliage and weather.</p>\r\r<h4>How can I prevent unintended charges on my bill?</h4>\r<p>You agree to pay all access, usage and other charges that you or any other user of your wireless device incurred. If multiple wireless devices are associated with your account, you agree \rto pay all charges incurred by users of those wireless devices. Many services and applications are accessible on or through wireless devices, including purchases of games, movies, music and \rother content. Some of these services are provided by Verizon Wireless. Others are provided by third parties that may offer the option to bill the charges to your Verizon Wireless bill or \rother methods of payment. Charges may be one&ndash;time or recurring. The amount and frequency of the charges will be disclosed to you or the person using your device or a device associated \rwith your account at the time a purchase is made. If the purchaser chooses to have the charges billed to your account, such charges will become part of the amount due for that billing \rcycle. <strong>Verizon Wireless offers tools to block or restrict these services, and to block all billing for third&ndash;party services on your Verizon Wireless bill, at \rverizonwireless.com/myverizon</strong></p>\r\r<h4>What charges are set by Verizon Wireless?</h4>\r<p>For Postpay Service, our charges include Federal Universal Service, Regulatory and Administrative charges, and we may also include other charges related to our governmental costs. We set \rthese charges; they aren&apos;t taxes, they aren&apos;t required by law, they are not necessarily related to anything the government does, they are kept by us in whole or in part, and the \ramounts and what they pay for may change.</p>\r\r<h4>Government taxes, fees and surcharges</h4>\r<p>You must pay all taxes, fees and surcharges set by federal, state and local governments. Please note that we may not always be able to notify you in advance of changes to these \rcharges.</p>\r\r<h4>What are roaming charges?</h4>\r<p>You&apos;re &quot;roaming&quot; whenever your wireless device uses a transmission site outside your Coverage Area or uses another company&apos;s transmission site. Sometimes roaming \rhappens even when you&apos;re within your Coverage Area. There may be higher rates and extra charges (including charges for long distance, tolls or calls that don&apos;t connect) for \rroaming calls, depending on your Plan.</p>\r\r<h4>How does Verizon Wireless calculate my charges?</h4>\r<p>For charges based on the amount of time used or data sent or received, we&apos;ll round up any fraction to the next full minute or, depending on how you&apos;re billed for data usage, \rthe next full megabyte or gigabyte. For outgoing calls, usage time starts when you first press <strong>Send</strong> or the call connects to a network, and for incoming calls, it starts \rwhen the call connects to a network (which may be before it rings). Usage time may end several seconds after you press <strong>End</strong> or after the call disconnects. For calls made on \rour network, we charge only for calls that are answered, including by machines. For Postpay Service, usage cannot always be processed right away and may be included in a later bill, but the \rusage will still count towards your allowance for the month when the Service was used.</p>\r\r<h4>How and when can I dispute charges?</h4>\r<p>If you&apos;re a Postpay customer, you can dispute your bill within 180 days of receiving it, but unless otherwise provided by law or unless you&apos;re disputing charges because your \rwireless device was lost or stolen, you still have to pay all charges until the dispute is resolved. If you&apos;re a Prepaid customer, you can dispute a charge within 180 days of the date \rthe disputed charge was incurred. <strong>YOU MAY CALL US TO DISPUTE CHARGES ON YOUR BILL OR ANY SERVICE(S) FOR WHICH YOU WERE BILLED, BUT IF YOU WISH TO PRESERVE YOUR RIGHT TO BRING AN \rARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS CASE REGARDING SUCH DISPUTE, YOU MUST WRITE TO US AT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE ADDRESS ON YOUR BILL, OR SEND US A COMPLETED NOTICE OF DISPUTE FORM (AVAILABLE AT \rVERIZONWIRELESS.COM) WITHIN THE 180&ndash;DAY PERIOD MENTIONED ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT NOTIFY US IN WRITING OF SUCH DISPUTE WITHIN THE 180&ndash;DAY PERIOD, YOU WILL HAVE WAIVED YOUR RIGHT TO \rDISPUTE THE BILL OR SUCH SERVICE(S) AND TO BRING AN ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS CASE REGARDING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.</strong></p>\r\r<h4>What are my rights for dropped calls or interrupted service?</h4>\r<p>If you drop a call in your Coverage Area, redial. If it&apos;s answered within 5 minutes, call us within 90 days if you&apos;re a Postpay customer, or within 45 days if you&apos;re a \rPrepaid customer, and we&apos;ll give you a 1&ndash;minute airtime credit. If you&apos;re a Postpay customer and you lose Service in your Coverage Area for more than 24 hours in a row and \rwe&apos;re at fault, call us within 180 days and we&apos;ll give you a credit for the time lost. Please be aware that these are your only rights for dropped calls or interrupted \rService.</p> \r\r<h4>About my payments</h4>\r<p>If you&apos;re a Postpay customer and we don&apos;t get your payment on time, we will charge you a late fee of up to 1.5 percent per month (18 percent per year) on the unpaid balance, or \ra flat &#36;5 per month, whichever is greater, if allowed by law in the state of your billing address. (If you choose another company to bill you for our Service [such as another Verizon \rcompany], late fees are set by that company or by its tariffs and may be higher than our late fees.) Late fees are part of the rates and charges you agree to pay us. If you fail to pay on \rtime and Verizon Wireless refers your account(s) to a third party for collection, a collection fee will be assessed and will be due at the time of the referral to the third party. The fee \rwill be calculated at the maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, not to exceed 18 percent. We may require a deposit at the time of activation or afterward, or an increased deposit. \rWe&apos;ll pay simple interest on any deposit at the rate the law requires. We may apply deposits or payments in any order to any amounts you owe us on any account. If your final credit \rbalance is less than &#36;1, we will refund it only if you ask. If your service is suspended or terminated, you may have to pay a fee to have service reactivated.</p> \r<p>If you&apos;re a Prepaid customer, you may replenish your balance at any time before the expiration date by providing us with another payment. Your balance may not exceed &#36;1,000 and \ryou may be prevented from replenishing if your balance reaches &#36;1,000. We will suspend service when your account reaches the expiration date and any unused balance will be \rforfeited.</p> <p> We may charge you up to &#36;25 for any returned check.</p>\r\r<h4>What if my wireless device gets lost or stolen?</h4>\r<p>We&apos;re here to help. It&apos;s important that you notify us right away, so we can suspend your Service to keep someone else from using it. If you&apos;re a Postpay customer and your \rwireless device is used after the loss or theft but before you report it, and you want a credit for any charges for that usage, we&apos;re happy to review your account activity and any \rother information you&apos;d like us to consider. Keep in mind that you may be held responsible for the charges if you delayed reporting the loss or theft without good reason, but you \rdon&apos;t have to pay any charges you dispute while they are being investigated. If you’re a California customer we haven&apos;t given you a courtesy suspension of recurring monthly \rcharges during the past year, we&apos;ll give you one for 30 days or until you replace or recover your wireless device, whichever comes first.</p>\r\r<h4>What are Verizon Wireless&apos; rights to limit or end service or end this Agreement?</h4>\r<p>We can, without notice, limit, suspend or end your Service or any agreement with you for any good cause, including, but not limited to: (1) if you: (a) breach this Agreement; (b) resell \ryour Service; (c) use your Service for any illegal purpose, including use that violates trade and economic sanctions and prohibitions promulgated by any US governmental agency; (d) install, \rdeploy or use any regeneration equipment or similar mechanism (for example, a repeater) to originate, amplify, enhance, retransmit or regenerate an RF signal without our permission; (e) \rsteal from or lie to us; or, if you&apos;re a Postpay customer; (f) do not pay your bill on time; (g) incur charges larger than a required deposit or billing limit, or materially in excess \rof your monthly access charges (even if we haven&apos;t yet billed the charges); (h) provide credit information we can&apos;t verify; or (i) are unable to pay us or go bankrupt; or (2) if \ryou, any user of your device or any line of service on your account, or any account manager on your account: (a) threaten, harass, or use vulgar and/or inappropriate language toward our \rrepresentatives; (b) interfere with our operations; (c) \"spam,\" or engage in other abusive messaging or calling; (d) modify your device from its manufacturer&apos;s specifications; or (e) \ruse your Service in a way that negatively affects our network or other customers. We can also temporarily limit your Service for any operational or governmental reason.</p>\r\r<h4>Am I eligible for special discounts?</h4>\r<p>If you&apos;re a Postpay customer, you may be eligible for a discount if you are and remain affiliated with an organization that has an agreement with us. Unless your discount is through \ra government employee discount program, we may share certain information about your Service (including your name, your wireless telephone number and your total monthly charges) with your \rorganization from time to time to make sure you&apos;re still eligible. We may adjust or remove your discount according to your organization&apos;s agreement with us, and remove your \rdiscount if your eligibility ends or your contract term expires. In any case, this won&apos;t be considered to have a material adverse effect on you.</p>\r\r<h4>Disclaimer of warranties</h4>\r<p><strong>We make no representations or warranties, express or implied, including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a \rparticular purpose, about your Service, your wireless device, or any applications you access through your wireless device.

This limitation and waiver will apply regardless of \rthe theory of liability. That means neither of us will try to get any indirect, special, consequential, treble or punitive damages from the other.

I agree that the account enrolled in the Program is in the employee's name. I agree that the wireless phones and equipment being purchased by me under the Program shall be activated on Verizon Wireless service. I agree that I may activate no more than ten (10) lines of service and no more than twenty (20) Connected devices on my Employee \rPhone Program account.&lt;/p&gt;\r&lt;p&gt;Through the Program, VZW offers subsidized access to wireless service and equipment for me and family members. The Program is intended to provide discounted service and equipment at rates not available to the general public with the intention of helping me become familiar with wireless service.&lt;/p&gt;\r\r&lt;p&gt;While travelling internationally, you may receive compressed versions of files &amp;ndash; including video files &amp;ndash; you stream or download, which will help reduce the amount of data you use.&lt;/p&gt;\r\r&lt;p&gt;All service provided in the Program is subject to Verizon Wireless business policies, practices, and procedures. Verizon Wireless reserves the right to make changes to the Program as well as its business practices and procedures at any time without notice and in its sole discretion.&lt;/p&gt;\r\r&lt;h4&gt;My Verizon and Paperless Billing&lt;/h4&gt;\r\r&lt;p&gt;I am responsible for processing all transactions through Verizon Wireless' self service options. This includes the IVR, &lt;a \rhref=&quot;http://www.verizonwireless.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.verizonwireless.com&lt;/a&gt;, and the My Verizon mobile application. It is my responsibility to utilize My Verizon to setup and remain on paperless billing upon immediate enrollment into the Program.&lt;/p&gt;\r\r&lt;h4&gt;Equipment Purchases&lt;/h4&gt;\r\r&lt;p&gt;My Verizon will display the most favorable price currently available to employees under the Program. I may purchase basic phones or smartphones for each line of service in my Program account, if qualified, with a Device Payment agreement. I may purchase tablets, data devices, or Connected devices for each line of service in my Program account with a two (2) year service agreement or, if qualified, a Device Payment agreement. I understand that My Verizon may display offers that are available to consumers that I am not eligible for under the Program. I may purchase accessories at discounted pricing as noted on My Verizon. All equipment purchases (including accessories) are subject to applicable state and local taxes. Equipment may be purchased via credit/debit card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover and debit cards with Visa or MasterCard logos). In addition, equipment and accessories may be billed to my Program account to the extent permitted by company policy. However, my Program account must be current before the next equipment purchase may be billed to it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\r&lt;p&gt;There are circumstances where I will not be allowed to purchase certain equipment due to inventory constraints or in order to provide these devices to customers first. I acknowledge that I will not purchase devices and place them on my employee account if Verizon Wireless communicates that I am not allowed to purchase these devices. Failure to comply with these restrictions will result in the removal of that equipment from my Program account.&lt;/p&gt;\r\r&lt;h4&gt;Device/Accessories Resale&lt;/h4&gt;\r\r&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge that I am prohibited from reselling devices purchased through the Program (including employee&amp;ndash;exclusive devices) during the 2 year contract term or while fulfilling the Device Payment agreement and from selling accessories purchased through the Program for profit as such actions would put myself in direct competition with Verizon Wireless. I understand that I may utilize programs like Hopeline and the Device Trade&amp;ndash;in Program to recycle my devices.&lt;/p&gt;\r\r&lt;h4&gt;Equipment Repair&lt;/h4&gt;\r\r&lt;p&gt;The Program does not cover insurance, theft, damage, or loss. It is solely my responsibility to purchase insurance.

I agree that I will pay for the monthly service and charges in my Program account when the current bill is due; or if I incur charges larger than a required billing limit or materially in excess of my monthly access charges (even if the charges have not been billed). I agree that if I fail to pay my bill I may be required to make immediate payment of any current/outstanding balances or services to all of my lines may be suspended.&lt;/p&gt;\r\r&lt;p&gt;If my Program account is permanently disconnected for failure to pay a delinquent balance and/or referred to a collection agency, in order to re&amp;ndash;establish service, I will be required to pay the balance in full on the account.&lt;/p&gt;\r\r&lt;h4&gt;Separation/Termination of Employment&lt;/h4&gt;\r\r&lt;p&gt;Upon separation/termination of employment with Verizon, any line(s) of service in my Program account must be either converted to a consumer account or deactivated.  After 15 days from the termination date, all employee discounts will be removed from my Program account and all lines activated under it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\r&lt;h4&gt;Account Maintenance&lt;/h4&gt;\r\r&lt;p&gt;To request changes to my Program account (plan changes, adding or removing features or optional services, device ID changes, etc.), I should visit My Verizon. Additional information and assistance can be found at the Verizon Employee Phone Program site (available via the intranet) or by contacting the Employee Accounts department for further assistance. At no time am I authorized to access or make changes on my own Program account or a Program account belonging to a co&amp;ndash;worker.&lt;/p&gt;\r\r&lt;p&gt;Failure to comply with any of the conditions or the Program may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\r&lt;p&gt;Last Updated: 05/26/17&lt;/p&gt;",
